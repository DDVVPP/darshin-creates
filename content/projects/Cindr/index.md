###### A social choose-your-own-adventure game.

Collaborated in a team of four to build a dating/friendship web app. Cindr takes the adventurer to their best possible matches based on a series of mythological storyline-questions. Adventurers will meet each other in different places in the game map by requesting to initiate conversation.
