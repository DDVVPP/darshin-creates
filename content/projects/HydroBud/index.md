###### A gamified hydration tracker.

**A four-day stackathon project.** I find that I drink too much coffee during the day, and not enough water which dries me out and depeletes my energy. As a result, Iâ€™ve created a hydration tracker called Hydro Bud that will recommend the ideal number of cups a day that a user should drink, and track the number of cups that are actually consumed, while building fun animated creatures to encourage healthy drinking habits.

\*The mobile app is still a work in progress. Please refer to figma layouts and GitHub Project for concept.<br/>
